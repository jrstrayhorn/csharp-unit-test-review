Code w/ Mosh - Unit Testing for C# Developers
=================================================

Benefits of Unit Tests
	Code Documentation!!
	Refactoring with Confidence

Types of Tests

- Unit - tests a unit of an application without its external dependencies
	- cheap to write
	- execute fast
	- no files, no database, no web services
	- don't give a lot of confidence of reliability of application

- Integration
	- tests the application with its external dependecies
	- with files, database, etc
	- take longer to execute (read/write to db)
	- give more confidence in health of application
	
- End-to-end
	- drives an application through its UI
	- selinium is a tool that does this
	- give you the greatest confidence
	- problem 1: very slow because you have ot launch application, login, submit form, see results
	- problem 2: very brittle

Test Pyramid
Should write all of them

Most tests should be unit tests (becvause easy to write)

Next should have some Integration tests (no ui)

Should write very few e2e test for only the key parts of UI, only happy path

Unit tests are great to write for quickly testing:
	- logic/calculations
	- conditional statements
	- loops
	- methods with complex logic or calculations
	- Calculate functions - can test all execution paths of method

Integration tests are better if application does a lot of just reading and writing from database

Takeaways
- Favour unit tests to e2e tests.
- Cover unit test gaps with integration tests.
- Use e2e tests sparingly. (only key functions of application)

Need a testing framework to write tests

NUnit - newest
MSTest - mS 
xUnit - gained more popularity

Give utility library to write test and test runner that runs the test.

Focus on the fundamentals not the tooling

Start with MSTest

Install NUnit later - longer history, more elegant

ReSharper - has faster and more powerful test runner - 

Rider - cross platform IDE - fast IDE and fast test runner
